That new enemy hits so hard!
We have developed a new mechanic to defend yourself and control the ship, personalized macros.
Now you can create your own macros with one command.
This is how you do: "macro macro-name command argument (id needed) command argument ..."
You can create a sequence of commands under one simple command, you can also add another macro instead of "command argument".
Also the command "delete macro-name" erase the macro. You can overwrite one macro but you can add a macro with the same name as the new one.
Let's see how you do with this new tool.
