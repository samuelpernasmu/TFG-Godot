Now the macros you created are saved and can be use on the nexts levels.
The AI we created it's named N.I.N.A, it doesn'y mean anything especial, but is a cool name!
Now it looks that has ta√±e control of the robot to train, i think we lost the control.
All i can say it' survive, we will try to take it down.
Good luck!
