From now on we won't be able to offer you new mechanics to fight, we are focus on take down N.I.N.A.
Last level had new enemies, impressive, look like the AI no is able to create new types of robots...
We are going to shut down the connection to the production center to avoid the creation of new robots, but it can create a lot of the ones you know.
I hope you survive this.
Good luck, Maverick!
