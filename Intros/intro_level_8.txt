We got it, we are inside the data center, in a few minutes we will end this once and for all.
But first we need more from you, you have to destroy 20 robots to create a breach on the system.
Everytime you destroy a robot the AI receive a signal, that how the simulation was prepared.
If you reach 20 kills the AI have to pause some process and restart one system, in that exact moment we can shut it down.
All hopes on you Maverick!
